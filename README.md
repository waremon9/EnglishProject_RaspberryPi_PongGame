English project in wich we had to make something on the Raspberry Pi Touchscreen.
So it's a game. A Pong.

Move the padel with the finger, collect bonus for easy win.

Comment and uncomment part of the code depending if you test on a PC or you play on the Raspi.

**You need to install the touchscreen master to use it on Raspi**
You can fin a tuto i made for a friend that can help to install it in the pytouchMaster folder.
