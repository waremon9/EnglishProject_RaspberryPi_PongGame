# Tutorial : how to handle multiple touch with the touch screen.

Using the *touchscreen*, if you want to be able to get multiple touch, install and import the ft5406 library. you can found it here : **https://github.com/pimoroni/python-multitouch**. Then download the ``python-multitouch-master.zip``.
(Or just take the one in the same folder as this doc)

And thank **pimoroni** for this usefull thing.

## install:

- extract
- use the terminal to go in python-multitouch-master\library (with cd)
- sudo python3 setup.py install
- it's now ready to use


## use:
Few example can be found in the zip. Use them and analyse them to see ho it works.

### import and initialize it:

```python
import ft5406
ts = ft5406.Touchscreen()
```


### Get all the touch:

Use a for each to get all.
```python
for touch in ts.poll():
    print(touch.slot, touch.id, touch.valid, touch.x, touch.y)
```

slot is the slot use by the touch, up to 10 from 0 to 9.
id is randomly selected every time you get a new touch.
valid is a boolean, true if the slot is used (finger on the screen) or false if unused.
x and y are the actual coordinate of the touch, when valid == false, keep the last coordinate.


### event:

You can also use event generated by tf5406:

```python
def touch_handler(event, touch):
    if event == TS_PRESS:
        print("Got Press", touch)
    if event == TS_RELEASE:
        print("Got release", touch)
    if event == TS_MOVE:
        print("Got move", touch)

for touch in ts.touches:
    touch.on_press = touch_handler
    touch.on_release = touch_handler
    touch.on_move = touch_handler

ts.run()

while True:
    # Redraw Code etc
    try:
        pass
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        ts.stop()
        exit()
```

i did not use it myself so you have to figure out how it work by yourself.

**Good luck.**
